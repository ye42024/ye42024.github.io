<P>serve the purpose of ensuring the survival of species. It is
also called survival of the <EM>fittest</EM>, fittest meaning the
one most capable of reproducing; i.e. reproductive success. GAY
PEOPLE CAN'T REPRODUCE.

<P>There are beneficial evolutions such as greater attractiveness
in peacocks. This makes it so they reproduce more. It is good for
the survival of the species and favored by "evolution" and natural
selection. BEING GAY IS NOT; they can't reproduce.

<P>The implication is that being gay is actually HARMFUL to the
species and its SURVIVAL. It is literally NOT FAVORED by forces
of nature like N<SMALL>ATURAL</SMALL> S<SMALL>ELECTION</SMALL>
due to its lack of reproductive success and, like all
harmful-to-reproduction traits, is worked against in the process
of N<SMALL>ATURAL</SMALL> S<SMALL>ELECTION</SMALL> because it
isn't passed down due to a lack of reproductive success; i.e.
fitness (as in survival of the fittest).</P>

<H2>Not a Gene</H2>

<P>You may say homosexuality (sodomy) is not a gene. That doesn't
matter; it is still harmful to reproduction, and thus natural
selection doesn't favor it. Even if it <EM>was</EM> passed down
in <EM>some</EM> way, it wouldn't matter BECAUSE GAY POEPLE CAN'T
RERPODUCE.

<H2>Love</H2>

<P>I am very sorry if I hurt your feelings. All love goes out to
all my gay brothers and sisters in Chr-st. I'm just trying to save
you from <A HREF="g-d-homophobic.htm">G-d's wrath</A> and inform
you of the truth, for the truth will set us free.

<P>Again, I'm sorry if I hurt anyone's feelings. I don't hate
anyone. I love everyone. I am Chr-stian. Nothing but love, and G-d
bless thee.

<P>If you're gay, love to you (no homo).

Please understand that the intent of this article is NOT to
condemn homosexuals; but rather, to take a Biblical stand against
the sinful Homosexual Agenda, especially their threat against our
children in this perverse and wicked generation. I make no
apologies for preaching THE TRUTH! Yet, I want you to understand
if you're a homosexual that God still loves you, and there is
Christian help available for you if you desire it, and God still
wants to save you from your sins and give to you eternal life.

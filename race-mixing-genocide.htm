See what I mean? <EM>All</EM> races have a right to exist. You
may think being against miscegenation (race-mixing) is racist, but
that's because that's what they've told you, and the people who
believed so were racist. But it's NOT racist! <EM>Every</EM> race
has its unique culture and people, and it should not be wiped out
by being thrown in the blender, the Machine.<P>

This is <EM>not</EM> paranoical. Just look at the undeniable <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_demographic_decline">
white people decline</A>. I love white people (I love everybody),
and so should you. Is it nothing to you, their slow <EM>extinction?</EM>
Numbers don't lie!<P>

When will this stop? It won't.White  Americans are expected to
become a <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_demographic_decline#United_States">
minority by 2045</A>.

You are beautiful, as are your genes, as is your people. You
deserve to exist. People who look like you deserve to exist. I
want my children to know all kinds of people. I don't want
everyone to be just like them. Do you? (, you racist?)<P>

You may think it's silly to not marry a certain race because of
their race, but it's not that you're racist. You're thinking about
the future! The future of your children! The future of your
people! Just look at what happens!<P>

<I>Race-mixing happened!</I><P>

You're not racist. You want blacks to keep on having black music
and black grandmas. You want Mexicans to keep on having pet
chickens and breakfast burritos. And you want white people to...
erm, well, look white! (jk they have culture too.)

<P><I>Note: despite the MS Paint drawings, this article is not
meant for kids.</I>

<P>Time for a biology lesson:

<OL TYPE="I">
<LI><P>Intercourse is for the purpose of reproduction. Sexual
ttraction is so we reproduce, for if there was no attraction,
we wouldn't reproduce, and life would go extinct.
<LI><P>People are attracted to certain aspects in people, and these
aspects are determined by biology.
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI><P>For men, these aspects are attractive features in women.
These features all have this in common: they are signs of
fertility. That's subconcious, though.<BR>
<IMG SRC="fertility.png" ALT="No wrinkles /sign of youth/ Large breasts /Ability to freastfeed/ Large buttocks /Sign of fertility/" TITLE="Examples of features attractive to males" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=200><BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>These are all beneficial for reproduction.</FONT></I>
<LI><P>For women, these are signs that they can take care of them,
such as that they are of high status, strong, etc. In modern
society, this aspect is primarily wealth. That's so them and their
kids are taken care of, and so she gets help throughout
child-rearing.
</OL>
<LI><P>Wherefore, it is unreasonable to say that men who are
attracted to younger women are pedophiles. It is by biology that
men are more attracted to younger women. Older men are not going
to be more attracted to older women than to more fertile women
because of biology.
<LI><P>There <EM>are</EM> exceptions, but this is
<I>paraphilia</I>. It is not of nature to be attracted to
unfertile women. For it is not biologically beneficial, and is
actually detrimental.
</OL>

<P>40 year olds can't reproduce as well as 20 year olds. It leads
to complications and is dangerous for both the child and the
woman, yet women are encouraged to marry into their latter years
(30s). Also, they don't have the energy to chase kids down at that
age.

<H2><I>Back In Time...</I></H2>

<IMG SRC="middleages.jpg" WIDTH=176 HEIGHT=187 ALIGN="right" ALT="Middle ages people">

<P>Back in the middle ages, girls married at around 12 (as is the
case of Romeo and Juliet). That was partly due to lower<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy#Variation_over_time">
life expectancies</A> (30-35).Wherefore we are left wondering,
is child marriage really that bad? It wasn't just in the middle
ages, though. That was the case all throughout history.

<P>Do you think animals wait 18 years? No, they copulate with
the most fertile females. That's biology.

<P>You don't even have to go back in time to observe this. In
third world countries, young pretty women marry older wealthy men
and have children. This is particularly true in the Middle East.

<H2>Pedophillia</H2>

<P>Pedophillia is another type of paraphillia, for it is not
beneficial for reproduciton. Prebubescent women are not fertile,
wherefore they can't reproduce. That's why prepubescent women
don't display the attractive features aforementioned. They can't
reproduce. Wherefore, by biology, the determining factor for
acceptable relatinoships is: have they menstruated?

<P>Currently, people think it's bad for seniors to date freshmen,
but that's how it is by biology. Younger women are more fertile,
have more attractive features, wherefore they are more attractive.
This is to maximize reproduction. It is biologically beneficial.

<H2>Wrong?</H2>

<P>People think seniors dating freshemn is wrong, pedophillic,
etc. but in it is nature. You may prefer a smaller age gap, but
when it is part of nature because it is biologically beneficial,
it's hard to find anything morally wrong with it.

<P>Also, when you consider that's how marriages have been
throughout <EM>all</EM> of history, it's hard to think such
relatinoship is wrong.

<P>What's actually offensive is for older <EM>women</EM> to date
younger men. It is against nature and against biology. That's a
phenomenom not observed in nature. It's paraphillia.

<H2>Disclaimer</H2>

<P>I am NOT a pedophile. I am not trolling. And I do NOT look like
this guy:<BR>

<P>If you're gonna call me a pedophlie, GT*O. I'm talking about
biology here.
